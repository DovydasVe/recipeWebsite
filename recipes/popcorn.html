    <p>INGREDIENTS
        <ul>
            <li>13 cups (140g) popped popcorn</li>
            <li>2 scoops (60g) protein powder (any flavor of choice)</li>
            <li>4 tbsp (60g) chunky natural peanut butter </li>
            <li>2 cups (480ml) water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (15g) Cheerios </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Cover a cookie sheet with a layer of foil or parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl,
        combine protein powder and water. Add popcorn, and slowly mix until popcorn is evenly
        coated with protein glaze. Warm peanut butter in microwave for about 10 seconds.
        Gently fold peanut butter and Cheerios into popcorn mixture. The popcorn will not stay
        completely puffed, so mix slowly carefully to keep it as fluffy as possible. Spoon mixture
        onto cookie sheet, and form into balls. Place in fridge to set.
